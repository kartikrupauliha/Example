<font size=5 color="red" face="arial"><p>Protein is an essential nutritional component in the human diet throughout life, as it secures growth in infancy, supports muscle and bone metabolism, ensures the maintenance and development of a normal nervous system, and helps to sustain muscle mass and physical performance in older ages, for instance. Yet, only rarely does the normal every-day Western diet not provide enough protein to meet daily requirements</p></font>

    <font size=5 color="red" face="arial"><p>Athletes may have elevated physiological protein requirements, to maintain adequate protein synthesis and energy production, as well as sufficient immune function and good gut integrity in the multi-stress conditions of goal-directed, frequent, intensive and/or prolonged exercise routines. Protein need increases along with the increasing intensity and duration of an athletic performance; therefore, protein should be included in the meals before and after the actual performance and regularly during the day to secure an efficient supply of essential, or indispensable, amino acids [5].</p></font></li>

<font size=5 color="red" face="arial"><p>Protein and amino acid supplements are widely marketed for athletes and habitually active consumers as muscle growth and performance-enhancing products, and high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are traditionally applied for weight-loss purposes. However, the knowledge about the nutritional significance and effects of dietary protein and sport supplement products varies greatly among sportspeople and lifestyle users, especially in relation to individual sports activity level and overall diet and metabolic state</p></font></li>

<font size=5 color="red" face="arial"><p>To meet these specific nutritional requirements, several foods and supplements have been developed. For example, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) supplementation is often utilized by athletes and has been proposed to reduce muscle soreness after intensive exercise and to improve training performance [6]. BCAA supplementation might have a role in regulating some brain neurotransmitter production and thus in fatigue development during exercise</p></font></li>

<font size=5 color="red" face="arial"><p>Often these supplements are consumed in addition to other protein-rich foods, and without any guidance from professional nutrition experts [1]. The workload of common gym attendees rarely reaches the level of professional athletes, and thus it has been suggested that the protein requirements for regular people with active lifestyles do not differ from the guidelines given for the average adult population [1].</p></font>.</li>
