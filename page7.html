                <h3> Helps Build Lean Muscles
                    Protein being the building block of cells, it helps to maintain your muscle and helps reduce muscle wasting. Eating adequate protein ensures that even if you walk a lot, cycle, swim or perform intense training exercises, your body gets what it needs immediately and this helps to build lean muscles. Those who want to build more muscles should increase their protein intake or opt for high protein supplements.

            <p><h3>Helps Boost Metabolism
                Proteins helps to boost the metabolism for a temporary duration.

            <p><h3>Aids Muscle Recovery & Growth
                When you perform high intensity exercises and follow a protein rich diet, it helps in muscle growth and strength. This is because it helps to prevent muscle breakdown. Protein shakes made with the help of high-quality protein supplements are an easy way to consume protein especially when you are caught up with work. These supplements have BCAAs present in them that play an important role in muscle recovery and growth after your intense workout activity.

                <h3>Helps You Stay Full For Longer
                    Protein helps you to feel full for a longer period. This is because protein promotes satiety (the feeling of fullness) which you may feel when you are protein deficient. This helps those athletes who stay on the ground for a long duration to play their sport and need to be actively involved in the game throughout. This also aids weight management as protein helps control appetite and hunger levels.
