            <p><h3>Protein is essential for muscle growth. Many athletes and gym enthusiasts consume protein shakes because they believe that these drinks will help them bulk up after strength training.

                A 2018 analysis of 49 studies supports the use of protein supplementation for this purpose. The research suggests that protein supplements significantly improve muscle size and strength in healthy adults who perform resistance exercise training, such as lifting weights.
                
                Protein supplementation was equally effective in men and women. However, the effectiveness may decrease with age, as older adults have higher protein requirements than younger people.

                Many studies reportTrusted Source that taking protein supplements after exercise can aid recovery by reducing muscle damage and improving muscle performance and muscle protein synthesis.

                <h3>The recommended daily intakeTrusted Source of protein for people aged 19 years and over is 46 g for women and 56 g for men.

                    People who find it challenging to meet these amounts, possibly including some vegans and vegetarians, may find that protein powder offers an easy solution to the problem.
                    
                    Athletes, weight lifters, older adults, and people with a chronic illness may need to exceed the general protein intake recommendation.
